This vignette is an introduction to performing survival analysis in **mlr3proba**.

## A very quick introduction to survival analysis

Survival analysis is a sub-field of supervised machine learning in which the aim is to predict
the survival distribution of a given individual. Arguably the main feature of survival analysis is
that unlike classification and regression, learners are trained on two features: 1. the time until the 
event takes place, 2. the event type: either censoring or death. At a particular time-point,
an individual is either: alive, dead, or censored. Censoring occurs if it is unknown if an individual is
alive or dead. For example, say we are interested in patients in hospital and every day it is recorded
if they are alive or dead, then after a patient leaves it is unknown if they are alive or dead, hence
they are censored.

In the case that there is no censoring, but a predicted probability distribution is still the goal,
then probabilistic regression learners are advised instead.

## Survival Tasks

Unlike `TaskClassif` and `TaskRegr` which have a single 'target' argument, `TaskSurv` mimics the
`survival::Surv` object and has three-four target arguments (dependent on censoring type)

```{r}
library(mlr3proba); library(mlr3); library(survival)

# type = "right" is default

TaskSurv$new(id = "right_censored", backend = survival::rats,
             time = "time", event = "status", type = "right")

task = TaskSurv$new(id = "interval_censored", backend = survival::bladder2[,-c(1, 7)],
                    time = "start", time2 = "stop", type = "interval2")
task
task$truth()[1:10]
```

## Train and Predict

```{r}

# create task and learner

veteran = mlr3misc::load_dataset("veteran", package = "survival")
task_veteran = TaskSurv$new(id = "veteran", backend = veteran, time = "time", event = "status")
learner = lrn("surv.coxph")

# train/test split 

train_set = sample(task_veteran$nrow, 0.8 * task_veteran$nrow)
test_set = setdiff(seq_len(task_veteran$nrow), train_set)

# fit Cox PH and inspect model

learner$train(task_veteran, row_ids = train_set)
learner$model

# make predictions for new data

prediction = learner$predict(task_veteran, row_ids = test_set)
prediction
```

## Evaluate - crank, lp, and distr

Every `PredictionSurv` object can predict one or more of:

* `lp` - Linear predictor calculated as the fitted coefficients multiplied by the test data.
* `distr` - Predicted survival distribution, either discrete or continuous. Implemented in **[distr6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distr6)**.
* `crank` - Continuous risk ranking.

`lp` and `crank` can be used with measures of discrimination such as the concordance index. Whilst
`lp` is a specific mathematical prediction, `crank` is any continuous ranking that identifies who is
more or less likely to experience the event. So far the only implemented learner that only returns a continuous
ranking is `surv.svm`. If a `PredictionSurv` returns an `lp` then the `crank` is identical to this.
Otherwise `crank` is calculated as the expectation of the predicted survival distribution. Note that 
for linear proportional hazards models, the ranking (but not necessarily the `crank` score itself)
given by `lp` and the expectation of `distr`, is identical.

```{r}
# In the previous example, Cox model predicts `lp` so `crank` is identical

all(prediction$lp == prediction$crank)
prediction$lp[1:10]

# These are evaluated with measures of discrimination and calibration.
# As all PredictionSurv objects will return crank, Harrell's C is the default measure.

prediction$score()

# distr is evaluated with probabilistic scoring rules.

measure = lapply(c("surv.graf", "surv.grafSE"), msr)
prediction$score(measure)

# Often measures can be integrated over mutliple time-points, or return
# predictions for single time-points

measure = msr("surv.graf", times = 60)
prediction$score(measure)
```

### Probability distributions with distr6

Predicted distributions are implemented in **[distr6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distr6)**, which
contains functionality for plotting and further analysis of probability distributions. See [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/distr6/) for full tutorials. Briefly we will go over the most important parts for **mlr3proba**.

```{r}
task = tgen("simsurv")$generate(20)
learner = lrn("surv.coxph")

# In general it is not advised to train/predict on same data

prediction = learner$train(task)$predict(task)

# The predicted `distr` is a VectorDistribution consisting of 300 separate distributions

prediction$distr

# These can be extracted and queried either invidually...

prediction$distr[1]$survival(60:70)
prediction$distr[1]$mean()

# ...or together

prediction$distr$cdf(60)[,1:10]
prediction$distr$mean()[,1:10]

# As well as plotted

plot(prediction$distr[1], "survival", main = "First 2 Survival Curves")
lines(prediction$distr[2], "survival", col = 2)
```


## Composition

Finally we take a look at the `PipeOp`s implemented in **mlr3proba**, which are used for composition
of predict types. For example, if a learner only returns a linear predictor, then `PipeOpDistrCompositor`
can be used to estimate a survival distribution. Or, if a learner returns a `distr` then
`PipeOpCrankCompositor` can be used to estimate `crank` from `distr`. See **[mlr3pipelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines)** for full tutorials and details on `PipeOp`s.

### PipeOpDistrCompositor

```{r}
library(mlr3pipelines)

# PipeOpDistrCompositor - Train one model with a baseline distribution,
# (Kaplan-Meier or Nelson-Aalen), and another with a predicted linear predictor.
task = tgen("simsurv")$generate(30)
leaner_lp = lrn("surv.gbm", bag.fraction = 1, n.trees = 50L)
leaner_distr = lrn("surv.kaplan")
prediction_lp = leaner_lp$train(task)$predict(task)
prediction_distr = leaner_distr$train(task)$predict(task)
prediction_lp$distr

# Doesn't need training. Base = baseline distribution. ph = Proportional hazards.

pod = po("distrcompose", param_vals = list(form = "ph", overwrite = FALSE))
prediction = pod$predict(list(base = prediction_distr, pred = prediction_lp))$output

# Now we have a predicted distr!

prediction$distr

# This can all be simplified by using the distrcompose wrapper

gbm.distr = distrcompositor(learner = lrn("surv.gbm", bag.fraction = 1, n.trees = 50L),
                             estimator = "kaplan",
                             form = "aft",
                             overwrite = FALSE)
gbm.distr$train(task)$predict(task)
```

### PipeOpCrankCompositor

Note that a `PredictionSurv` will always return `crank`, but this may either be the same as the `lp` or
the expectation of `distr`. This compositor allows you to change the estimation method.

```{r}
# PipeOpCrankCompositor - Only one model required.
leaner = lrn("surv.coxph")
prediction = leaner$train(task)$predict(task)

# Doesn't need training - Note: no `overwrite` option as `crank` is always
# present so the compositor if used will always overwrite.

poc = po("crankcompose", param_vals = list(method = "mean"))
composed_prediction = poc$predict(list(prediction))$output

# Note that whilst the actual values of `lp` and `crank` are different,
# the rankings are the same, so discrimination measures are unchanged.

prediction$crank[1:10]
composed_prediction$crank[1:10]
all(order(prediction$crank) == order(composed_prediction$crank))
cbind(Original = prediction$score(), Composed = composed_prediction$score())

# Again a wrapper can be used to simplify this
crankcompositor(lrn("surv.coxph"), method = "mean")$train(task)$predict(task)
```

## All Together Now

Putting all of this together we can perform a (overly simplified) benchmark experiment to find the best learner for making predictions on a simulated dataset.

```{r}
library(mlr3pipelines); library(mlr3); library(mlr3tuning); library(paradox)
set.seed(42)

task = tgen("simsurv")$generate(50)

composed_lrn_gbm = distrcompositor(lrn("surv.gbm", bag.fraction = 1, n.trees = 50L),
                                   "kaplan", "ph")

lrns = lapply(paste0("surv.", c("kaplan", "coxph", "parametric")), lrn)
lrns[[3]]$param_set$values = list(dist = "weibull", type = "ph")

design = benchmark_grid(tasks = task, learners = c(lrns, list(composed_lrn_gbm)),
                        resamplings = rsmp("cv", folds = 2))

bm = benchmark(design)
bm$aggregate(lapply(c("surv.harrellC","surv.graf","surv.grafSE"), msr))[,c(4, 7:9)]
```
